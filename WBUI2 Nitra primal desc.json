(This applies to all structures). 9 Platforms ocean per tribe.\r\n3. Don't build too close to another base.\r\n4. Generated boss dinos are 'FORBIDDEN' in other players' bases. if I have a report with proof its a ban.\r\n5. Your inventory will not be replaced if it is lost. As such please make BPs of any items, clone all your tames and soultrap them and put ALL in a DS VAULT.\r\n6. Pick up your trap after taming.\r\n7. Don’t use Ark Data to transfert your dinos and stuffs between cluster. NO REFUND.\r\n8. Forbidden on setting up a personal store ... Rip structures.\r\n9. For ASA NItrado use DS Structures Mods and Put 2 shields to protect your bases a big and a little to avoid wild dinos destroy your benchs stuffs & dinos....\r\n10. I can't guarantee the stability of nitrados servers, I use them to advertise my dedicated servers. That's why I won't be held responsible for lost items/dinos bought in stores after a crash a bug saves or a wild dino who destroy structures.....",
